# Bible IO JS Word

This repository contains the source code used by a microsoft word plugin for the Bible OI project (www.bibleget.io). This plugin allows to insert a biblical text in the Word document, by providing the biblical quote. This useful for all those people who have write documents using many references to the Holy Scriptures. The plugin also let search quotes by a keyword, and set the prefered style for the quotes inserted.

## Debugging

The plugin will be published in the microsoft store, but until then, you can use it by:
1. downloading the source code, running the code with "npm run start:web". 
2. Then, in the browser, you may open a word document in the web version and
3. install the plugin in the insert menu, with the complements option.
4. You will see a new icon "Bible Get" in the Home tab.

This version will let you look for the biblical text by quote or by keyword. But, eventhough you may configure the style (in the settings option), this style is not yet applied to the inserted text.
